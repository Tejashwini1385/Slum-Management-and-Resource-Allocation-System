# Slum Management and Resource Allocation System

This project implements a modular system to support smart and sustainable slum area development using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The program prioritizes and allocates limited resources like healthcare, electricity, hygiene, and leadership by analyzing real-world data patterns.

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Slum areas often suffer from uneven access to essential resources due to limited infrastructure and poor prioritization. The goal of this project is to:

- Identify high-priority slum zones for hospital expansion
- Optimize electricity routing to reduce cost
- Highlight hygiene-deficient areas for sanitation planning
- Rank panchayat leaders based on qualifications
- Identify crime hotspots for safety improvement

All decisions are made using structured, algorithm-based logic.
